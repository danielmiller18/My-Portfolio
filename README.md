For this project I utilized two CSS and HTML pages for easy navigation throughout the page. This personal portfolio will be a "living" project in that it will be continually added to as part of my journey in the coding world.

I hope to use this page in the real world as I apply for jobs and update it with more features such as JavaScript and more funactionality for increased interactivity.
